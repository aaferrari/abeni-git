Abeni 0.0.2


There are minor bugs/new features needed noted in the software with #TODO


Documentation:

    Tutorials:
        * Show how to make ebuild for:
            + Basic C - configure && make

            + Eclasses:
                - Python with distutils
                - KDE

    Convert online help to Gentoo documentation XML templates

    Show actual ebuilds in portage that are good examples for specific scenarios

Bugs:


    Need to check if people have saved/changed ebuilds before loading/creating new one

    Comments not inside functions are not being saved in loaded ebuilds, except for headers.

    Editors (wxStyledTextCtrl) needs work on syntax and keyword highlighting.
        * Need 'all' Gentoo public/private functions added (panels.py)
        * Syntax highlighting is buggy for multi-line variables, see RDEPENDS/DEPENDS

    Order of funtions is not kept when importing, then saving. This is a cosmetic problem
    only. It'd be nice to order them logically: src_unpack, src_compile, src_install etc.
        * Got the importing done, need to fix saving

    When you delete a notebook page, the control gets screwy looking. I'm sure
    this is a wxPython bug, but I may be able to .refresh() the window to fix it?
        * Seems to be a wxPython 2.4.0.7 bug. Who shall release first, Abeni 1.0 or wxpython 2.4.0.8?

    If DEPEND is not set or empty, set it to = {$RDEPEND} for clarity and to make lintool happy


Add Features:

    Add confirmation dialog when creating or viewing diffs and add option to choose file to compare opened ebuild with.

    Add option to run ebuild/emerge without checking for password when people have commands setup with sudo.

    If running root, don't ask for password. Bad idea?

    Options screen:
        Not sure if I should add these:
        * Run lintool after loading ebuild <yes/no>
        * Run lintool after saving <yes/no>
        * Create digest after saving <yes/no>

    Create diff of ebuild
        * Gentoo prefers diffs of previous ebuild with user-submitted ebuild
        * Its good to see how Abeni changes original ebuild
        * Got it working, saves in ~/.abeni, but needs sanity checking to see what they
          are diffing against. Need dialog to verify 'diff x y' or let them choose.
          Right now it diffs PORTDIR/{$P} against PORTDIR_OVERLAY/{$P}

    Feature to check online to see if there is a newer version of Abeni available

    Eclass templates for the most common secnarios:
        * Python distutils
        * KDE etc.

    View /usr/portage/skel.ebuild for reference

    Download, unpack and view Makefile/configure from source tarball


Misc:

    Create abeni-cvs ebuild for testing nightly builds
