There are minor bugs/new features needed noted in the software with #TODO


Documentation:

    1) Tutorials:
        * Show how to make ebuild for:
            + Basic C - configure && make

            + Eclasses:
                - Python with distutils
                - KDE

    2) Convert online help to Gentoo documentation templates

    3) Show actual ebuilds in portage that are good examples for specific scenarios
    4) Link to Daniel Robbins Bash/ebuild tutorial
    	* http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/library/bash3.html

Bugs:

    1) Need to parse /etc/make.conf. Right now I'm using default locations such
       as /usr/portage and /usr/local/portage (PORTDIR_OVERLAY)

    2) Variables are not kept in order when imported

    3) Need to check if people have saved changed ebuilds before loading/creating new one

    4) Comments not inside functions are not being saved in imported ebuilds

    5) Only Netscape/Mozilla/Firebird works for help
        * I think this is a bug in Gentoo's Firebird shell script that opens Firebird
          when using Python's webbrowser module.

    6) Editors (wxStyledTextCtrl) needs work on syntax and keyword highlighting.
        * Need 'all' Gentoo public/private functions added (panels.py)
        * Syntax highlighting is buggy for multi-line variables, see RDEPENDS/DEPENDS

    7) Order of funtions is not kept when importing, then saving. This is a cosmetic problem
       only. It'd be nice to order them logically: src_unpack, src_compile, src_install etc.


Add Features:

    1) Options screen:
        * diff program (xterm -e diff, kompare etc.)
        * Default browser for help files (Konqueror, Firebird etc.)
        * Run lintool after importing ebuild <yes/no>
        * Run lintool after saving <yes/no>
        * Create digest after saving <yes/no>

    2) Create diff of ebuild
        * Gentoo prefers diffs of previous ebuild with user-submitted ebuild
        * Its good to see how Abeni changes original ebuild

    3) Add 'ebuild' command to menu with option to pass any command:
        * ebuild <current ebuild file> digest

    4) Add 'emerge' command to menu with option to pass any args:
        * ebuild -<args> <current ebuild file>

    5) Feature to check online to see if there is a newer version of Abeni available

    6) Eclass templates for the most common secnarios:
        * Python distutils
        * KDE etc.

    7) View /usr/portage/skel.ebuild for reference


Misc:

    1) Create abeni-cvs ebuild for testing nightly builds
