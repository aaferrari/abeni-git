Abeni 0.0.4


There are minor bugs/new features needed noted in the software with #TODO


Documentation:

    Tutorials:
        * Show how to make ebuild for:
            + Basic C - configure && make

            + Eclasses:
                - Python with distutils
                - KDE

    Convert online help to Gentoo documentation XML templates

    Show actual ebuilds in portage that are good examples for specific scenarios

    Link to Daniel Robbins Bash/ebuild tutorial
    	* http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/library/bash3.html


Bugs:


    Need to check if people have saved/changed ebuilds before loading/creating new one

    Editors (wxStyledTextCtrl) needs work on syntax and keyword highlighting.
        * Need 'all' Gentoo public/private functions added (panels.py)
        * Syntax highlighting is buggy for multi-line variables, see RDEPENDS/DEPENDS

    Order of funtions is not kept when importing, then saving. This is a cosmetic problem
    only. It'd be nice to order them logically: src_unpack, src_compile, src_install etc.
        * Got the importing done, need to fix saving. Note: Doesn't affect performance, just cosmetic.

    When you delete a notebook page, the control gets screwy looking. I'm sure
    this is a wxPython bug, but I may be able to .refresh() the window to fix it?
        * Seems to be a wxPython 2.4.0.7 bug. Who shall release first, Abeni 1.0 or wxpython 2.4.0.8?


Add Features:

    Add confirmation dialog when creating or viewing diffs and add option to choose file to compare opened ebuild with.

    Add option to run ebuild/emerge without checking for password when people have commands setup with sudo.

    If running root, don't ask for password. Bad idea?

    Options screen:
        Not sure if I should add these:
        * Run lintool after loading ebuild <yes/no>
        * Run lintool after saving <yes/no>
        * Create digest after saving <yes/no>

    Create diff of ebuild
        Need dialog to verify 'diff filex filey' or let them choose.
        Right now it diffs current ebuild vs last loaded.

    Feature to check online to see if there is a newer version of Abeni available

    Eclass templates for the most common secnarios:
        * Python distutils
        * KDE etc.
        * Done: distutils, CVS eclasses

    View /usr/portage/skel.ebuild for reference

    Download, unpack and view Makefile/configure from source tarball


Misc:

    Create abeni-cvs ebuild for testing nightly builds
