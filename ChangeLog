0.0.5 -------------

Jun 24, 2003

You can bring up a list of available ebuilds if you start abeni with 'abeni <package>'
This will bring up a dialog you can use to choose from (it uses output of etcat -v <package>)

Fixed problem with functions that were getting written even though there were deleted

Better ordering of variables.

Added many more Gentoo keywords to highlight list in Scintilla editor

Jun 23, 2003

Moved Misc statements up, Other Variables down on the screen.

Jun 19, 2003

Checks for category and verifies PORTDIR has it before saving.

0.0.4 -------------

Fixed 'emerge unmerge' to use package instead of full path to filename

Fixed bug where it was creating CVS type ebuild when you did New ebuild

Places DEPEND/RDEPEND in proper order if DEPEND=${RDEPEND}

Detects functions that start with capital letters, or has combinations like in glibc:
KV_to_int(), get_KHV() etc.

Indents comments to the proper level when ebuild is imported.

Convert spaces to tabs during import. Works good, but not perfect if
they use retarted space tab space etc. combo. Are there any shell script
tabify-ers/beautifiers out there?

Open ebuild if you pass filename on command line

Added full path to ebuild in statusbar

Changed layout of titlebar to ebuild | Abeni __version__

When creating diff file or viewing diff file it now compares opened ebuild
with last ebuild opened (stored in self.lastFile)

Was writing to /usr/share/abenirc instead of ~/.abeni/abenirc

Created dialogs.py and moved dialogs from abeni.py there

Fixed path to digest.png



0.0.3 -------------

Main reason for this version was to change setup.py to not install
documentation and put icons in new location.

Added 'emerge' command to menu with option to pass any args:
    * ebuild <args> <current ebuild file>

Added 'ebuild' command to menu with option to pass any command:
    * ebuild <current ebuild file> compile



0.0.2 -------------

Added /usr/bin/repoman-safe.py. Version of repoman for non-developers.

Creating a digest opens xterm and asks for password (su -c ebuild foo digest)

Ability to delete functions or variables

Removed wxHelp system, use online html now with web browser of choice

New icons on toolbar for new variable, new function (thanks far from Gentoo forums)

Added icons on toolbar for lintool and create digest

Create or update a digest

Saves history of recent ebuilds loaded and saved, accessible via File menu

Import portage to parse /etc/make.conf to get PORTDIR, PORTDIR_OVERLAY, DISTDIR

Variables are now kept in order they appear in original ebuild when imported and saved.

Functions are shown in order loaded from original ebuild.
