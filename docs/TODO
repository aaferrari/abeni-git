This is the TODO file for Abeni.

Immediate:


* repoman console:

  stop button

  After copying ebuild from overlay-> cvs, notify if
  non-digest in overlay/files exist that don't exist in cvs

  confirm deletion in repoconsole

  update cvs dir=/whatever label

  warn if ebuild is diff from overlay

  warn if ebuild has epatch but files in $FILESDIR not added to cvs?

  cp ebuild to cvs in repoman menu option, in case they don't want to use 
  repoman console

When copying ebuild from PORTDIR to PORTDIR_OVERLAY, check if non-digest files 
in PORTDIR/FILESDIR and warn, tell them to press F8 to copy them if needed.

Convert files from unicode to ascii before displaying in
vanilla text viewer, or use wxStyledTxtCtrl if that doesn't
crash on unicode.

* Ideas:
 - Option to archive ebuild in archive directory or sql db instead of just deleting it

* General:
 - Flash Stop button when executing background'ed command, like launching
   web browser so we know something is happening.
 - Improve open from overlay dialog to use notebook and let you choose from
   multiple overlays
 - Option to use different overlay directories for saving ebuilds to by default
 - When you inherit an eclass, scan the functions and add them to Scintilla's
   keyword list for highlighting and auto-completion
 - Improve find / search&replace dialog: "whole word", "match case" not implemented
 - Don't let user edit current ebuild through Files tab

* Repoman/CVS:
 - Don't allow CVS operations if ssh-agent/gpg-agent isn't running 
   Future: When gpg-agent is stable

* Website:

 - Needs make-over

* Syntax checking/formatting ebuilds:

 - Warning if /usr/local is in ${D}
 - Warn if ${D}/var/tmp/portage/pkg... 
 - Dynamic slots like in mod_php are a bad thing because portage can't detect them.
 - Give warning if inherit isn't first thing in ebuild after comments, unless CVS vars

* Documentation:

 - Its out of date, website needs big makeover
 - Private portage functions needs help in html format

* Command line options:

    * -c, --create <src_uri>            Create ebuild using src_uri to determine package and filename
    * -e, --eclass <eclass name>        Add inherit and appropriate functions for eclass, used with --created
    * -v, --variable <x=val, y=val...>  Add variable(s) and their value(s)
    * -f, --function <func1, func2...>  Add function name(s)
    * -h, --help                        Show list of command line options
    * -b, --bump <version>              Bump the given ebuild up to <version>
    * -d, --digest                      Create digest.
    * -C, --category <category>         Set package category
    * -l, --license <license>           Set LICENSE
    * -i, --iuse <iuse>                 Set IUSE
    * -t, --description <description>   Set DESCRIPTION
    * -a, --homepage <homepage>         Set HOMEPAGE
    * -k, --keywords <keywords>         Set KEYWORDS
    * -o, --slot <slot>                 Set SLOT
    * -p, --pretend                     Show which package would be used with --bump, and version numbers.

    Example One:
    We have a python program that uses 'python setup.py install':

    abeni --create 'http://abeni.sf.net/foo-0.1.tgz' --eclass 'distutils' --category 'app-admin' --digest

    This would create an ebuild named foo-0.1.ebuild in
	PORTDIR_OVERLAY/app-admin, fetch the source code and create the digest,
    creating a complete ebuild, ready to be emerged.

    Example Two:
    We have package app-admin/cheese with cheese-0.0.1.ebuild.
	cheese-0.0.2.tar.gz was released today. We simply want to create a
    bumped-up version of the ebuild:

    abeni --bump app-admin/cheese-0.0.1 0.0.2
    cheese-0.0.1.ebuild will be bumped up to cheese-0.0.2.ebuild
    (new ebuild created with digest)
