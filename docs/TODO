This is the TODO file for Abeni.

 wx.CallAfter(self.EnsureCaretVisible)

* General:
 - Change focus to log window when doing emerge
 - Add separator after menu, between groups Cat, PN, PV? (test with various gtk styles)
 - Option to sort functions: src_unpack then src_compile, src_install etc.
   (See ebuild.py by genone, it can probably do that easily)
 - Need function to check/warn if external apps exist every time someone tries to launch
   the external editor, web browser etc.
 - When you inherit an eclass, scan the functions and add them to Scintilla's
   keyword list for highlighting and auto-completion
 - Get dev email from env var: ECHANGELOG_USER="Rob Cakebread <pythonhead@gentoo.org>"
   then fill in option in dev prefs.
 - Disable menus when not in edit mode
 - Improve find / search&replace dialog: "whole word", "match case" don't work
 - Lowercase PN when given URI on new ebuilds in GetURIDialog.py
 - New feature: Launch browser to HOMEPAGE url
 - Need function to extract variables from editor (see genone's ebuild.py)
 - Don't let user edit current ebuild through Explorer

* Repoman/CVS:

 - Test signing of manifests
 - Don't allow CVS operations if ssh-agent isn't running 
 - New feature: rm -rf CVS/cat/PN then 'cvs update' in CVS/cat

* Dialogs:

 - Add Notes dialog with bugzilla bug# field, launch browser to bug#. When committing 
   to CVS we can include bug# automatically.
 - metadata.xml templates to choose from, for all the herds you belong to
 - When deleting ebuild, offer to rm -rf package dir when there are no more ebuilds

* Website:

  - Needs make-over

* Syntax checking/formatting ebuilds:

 - Validate metadata.xml
 - Remove trailing spaces on save. 
 - Warn on leading whitespace or try to convert to tabs
 - Give warning if /usr/local is in ${D}
 - Give warning when SLOTS are not numeric. Dynamic slots like in 
   mod_php are a bad thing because portage can't detect them.
 - Give warning if inherit isn't first thing in ebuild, unless CVS
 - Check Common Ebuild Mistakes, see if we can auto-fix any

* Documentation:

 - Its out of date, website needs big makeover
 - Private portage functions needs help in html format

* Command line options:

    * -s, --create <src_uri>            Create ebuild using src_uri to determine package and filename
    * -e, --eclass <eclass name>        Add inherit and appropriate functions for eclass, used with --created
    * -v, --variable <x=val, y=val...>  Add variable(s) and their value(s)
    * -f, --function <func1, func2...>  Add function name(s)
    * -h, --help                        Show list of command line options
    * -b, --bump <version>              Bump the given ebuild up to <version>
    * -d, --digest                      Create digest. Used with --bump
    * -c, --category <category>         Set package category
    * -l, --license <license>           Set LICENSE
    * -i, --iuse <iuse>                 Set IUSE
    * -t, --description <description>   Set DESCRIPTION
    * -a, --homepage <homepage>         Set HOMEPAGE
    * -k, --keywords <keywords>         Set KEYWORDS
    * -o, --slot <slot>                 Set SLOT
    * -p, --pretend                     Show which package would be used with --bump, and version numbers.

    Example One:
    We have a python program that uses 'python setup.py install':

    abeni --create 'http://abeni.sf.net/foo-0.1.tgz' --eclass 'distutils' --category 'app-admin' --digest

    This would create an ebuild named foo-0.1.ebuild in
	PORTDIR_OVERLAY/app-admin, fetch the source code and create the digest,
    creating a complete ebuild, ready to be emerged.

    Example Two:
    We have package app-admin/cheese with cheese-0.0.1.ebuild.
	cheese-0.0.2.tar.gz was released today. We simply want to create a
    bumped-up version of the ebuild:

    abeni --bump app-admin/cheese --pretend
    (Output shows:)
    cheese-0.0.1.ebuild will be bumped up to cheese-0.0.2.ebuild

    This is what we want so we issue:
    abeni --bump app-admin/cheese --digest

    cheese-0.0.2.ebuild is created in PORTDIR_OVERLAY/app-admin/cheese/
    The digest is updated. cheese-0.0.2.ebuild is ready to emerge.

* Known problems:

 - The first entry in the Most-Recently-Used list is shown without the path,
   the other entries contain the full path (seems to be wxPython/wxGTK bug)

 - I've had problems with the cursor vanishing in the editor when it
   loses focus and you focus it again. Author of wxPython says its a known
   issue and won't be fixed in 2.4*.  Verified fixed in wxPython 2.5*
   (2.4* used an old version of Scintilla)
