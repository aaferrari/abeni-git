The ebuild runs 'python setup.py install' to install Abeni.

All your ebuilds are saved in your PORTDIR_OVERLAY directory, which is
defined in /etc/make.conf. Make sure you have +rw on PORTDIR_OVERLAY

By default PORTDIR_OVERLAY is /usr/local/portage if it isn't set in /etc/make.conf

All ebuilds are saved in PORTDIR_OVERLAY, as opposed to /usr/portage,
so they won't be erased after every 'emerge rsync'.

The help system is online via the web at the moment. Set your favorite web browser under Options.
