The ebuild runs 'python setup.py install' to install Abeni.

All your ebuilds are saved in your PORTDIR_OVERLAY directory, which is
defined in /etc/make.conf. It is NOT set by default, so please go uncomment
it.

All ebuilds are saved in PORTDIR_OVERLAY, as opposed to /usr/portage,
so they won't be erased after every 'emerge rsync'.

The help system is online via the web at the moment. Your default
web browser should be launched from within Abeni to reach all the
help files.
